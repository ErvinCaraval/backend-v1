      # Documentation for every step is embedded above.

    # Justification for improvements:
    # - Matrix strategy ensures compatibility across Node.js versions.
    # - Caching and npm ci optimize speed and reliability.
    # - Parallel jobs (lint, test, load, chaos) maximize resource usage.
    # - Coverage validation and notifications enforce quality gates.
    # - Security and secret scanning protect against vulnerabilities.
    # - Artifact upload and cleanup maintain workspace hygiene.
    # - Embedded comments/documentation aid maintainability.
    # - Rollback step ensures atomicity and safe failure handling.
